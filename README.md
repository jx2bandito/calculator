# JavaScript Calculator<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a calculator powered by JS,
and thus shares some of its limitations such as really small numbers being considered 0 and really large 
numbers being considered infinity. This project was part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
